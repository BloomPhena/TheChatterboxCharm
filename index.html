    <p>OMG? It‚Äôs been so long since I logged into this. I finally remembered my password after misplacing it somewhere
      many years ago. The world has changed so much. People don't even BLOG anymore!! AP Research is truly a class I
      will never forget. It has prepared me so much for my future endeavors in college as well as in my career where my
      boss is always nagging me for reports bi-weekly. Despite all my worries, I got a qualifying score on my exam! My
      friends are also doing extremely well too! As a matter of fact, we all went on a girls trip pretty recently to
      Turkey. I became a journalist, like I wanted to 18 years ago. Gale became a newscaster. I see her on the news all
      the time whenever I turn on the TV in the mornings. Tieran recently won an award for best animated feature, and
      Sandra owns her own art therapy practitioner (it was featured in top 10 best up-coming businesses this year!).
      Tahsin became an award-winning novelist for her autobiography. Lastly, Julika became a travel influencer with a
      large following on social media! <br><br> - XoXo Sami

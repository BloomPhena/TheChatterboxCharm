  <h2>mood | excited ₍₍⚞(˶˃ ᵕ ˂˶)⚟⁾</h2> <br>
  <p>Hi! Welcome to my first ever blog entry. <br><br> Before I write anything, here’s some fun facts about me! During my free time I like to document my life through words and images, so I constantly find myself lost in photography and journaling. I also love talking to my friends on MySpace, so if you want to reach out to me my user is <strong>@Sami_Sparklez</strong>. It's currently the summer before my senior year, which I can’t wait for!!!! I really want to join the Newspaper club at my school, that way, I can broadcast important news, and know what it's like to be a real reporter. I’m a little bit nervous though because I know it’s extremely competitive to get into, so I won’t get my hopes up. Anyways, my summer is extremely boring without my friends. So far I’ve travelled to Michigan, Boston, and Connecticut so I was able to take some amazinggggggg flicks! I can’t wait to explore the world once I graduate and go to college. I’m looking to join new group chats and communities, so if you know any fun ones, feel free to message me!

    <p>I LOVE THE SUMMER SO MUCH! I wish the summer would last longer but I’ve also been missing my friends LOTS! I wish I could spend so much more time with them this summer but I've been going through so much stress T-T. My father wants me to invest my time into law books… he keeps pressuring me and saying that after I graduate I MUST get into a college like John Jay. My mother understands my circumstances though, she supports my passion for writing :D! My mother is the bestttt!

    <p>OMG!!! My final schedule for school finally came out!!!! I was assigned to 4 AP classes, I was only expecting to take 2 this year T-T. Guys please let me know if you guys have any tips for taking APUSH, AP Research, APES and … ugh!!!! AP CALC!! I can’t believe they signed me up for this class. I don’t even remember applying for it. Should I email the school coordinator and ask to drop it? I’ve heard so many horror stories about calc and research… Wish me luck guys, I’ll write to you in a bit.

    <p>School just started! I got to see all my besties again :D
      I met all of my teachers today, they mostly gave off a good impression… except for my AP CALCULUS teacher, she gave us a math assessment ON THE FIRST day of school!!! Sigh, it's going to be a long year. Also, we have to start thinking about what colleges we’re going to apply to, it's so much pressure. On the bright side, I got into the newspaper club! I'm so excited to be in this club because it’s gonna give me some experience in journalism. I actually just started working on my first report, which is basically a greeting to my dedicated readers XD

    <p>Soooo I've started my AP Research process. I’ve been thinking about what I’m gonna do for my AP Research project. I want my topic to be focused on video games, because I love playing them. But I’ve noticed that a lot of girls who play video games are subject to hostility, so it would be really interesting to dive into that with my project. No one else really talks about it that much.It’s nerve wracking that I'm gonna have to stick to this topic for the rest of my school year too. I also found out about the entirety of the course in the syllabus.. a 15-20 minute presentation T-T. Not just that, I ALSO have to write a 4000-5000 word paper!!!! I knew I was scared of this class for a reason!

I feel like an adult who knows how to take care of themselves. But I don't, my mom still reminds me it's time to  eat. Will I ever get Anyways today I watched videos in the AP classroom. And I took notes. My very first notes for this class!! Want to know of the things I learned, you know I would just tell you anyways. There are different researchers for different disciplines, wait, what are those again?? So disciplines are different branches of knowledge-AND WHEN DID WE STOP USING THE WORD SUBJECT 😭

      I like analytical scientists, they seem hot.

I thought they would leave me but no, they were being dragged across the dirty floor or wherever she was walking. Even worse, I can’t find an academic advisor that I am happy enough with. Tiran said that I was lucky that I had options, but like guys if you had an advisory without their phd, it's just as good as nothing.

    <p>I’ve started my literature review!! Honestly, it doesn’t seem that hard since I just have to explain my sources from my BIBs!! However, I do notice that my classmates and my friends are getting worse as the days go by… they seem entirely different as to what they looked like on the first day of school.

    <p>Literature review completed! Next step is my methodology where I have to choose a method to gather data for my topic!!! Update on my friends, they seem really out of it. They don’t talk to me anymore, they only ever seem to be focusing on pieces of their paper… like it’s the only thing they’re ever thinking about these days. What makes it weirder is that I feel like I'm the only person who’s been noticing these changes. Whenever I pass by them in class, their skins are a weird sickly green color, and their eyebags are miles deep… I’m worried that they are losing their sanity.. <br><br><strong>Note:</strong> I will be shutting down the community functionality on the bulletin board, I wanted a place where we could all talk as a community, but things are getting too out of hand for me. I am just a high school blogger. Any other chatterbox charm bulletins are not mine.

Even though I’m super excited right now, a deep part of me is extremely scared. There seems to be some weird virus going on in my AP Research class, and a lot of my classmates are being absent. On the days that they do show up, they come to school dragging their feet, making weird gurgling noises and they have red spotty patches all over their skin…. Does anyone know what this is????

    <p>It feels like I've been practicing all day, and all night! I could practically present with my eyes closed (maybe.. not quite) (o_o). Anyways, I should probably pick out an outfit for my presentation. Well… I do have to look quite professional since this is being recorded. Maybe just some suit pants, and a dress shirt will do. I’ll also try to steal my mothers blazer from when she used to attend interviews >:). Another piece of advice I got from my teacher is to also pin my bangs back, this is to prevent any hair from getting in my way when i’m presenting!

    <p>AAAHHH!! It's presentation day. Although I practiced plenty of times, I'm still nervous about my presentation. What if I make a mistake?? What if I go over time and stutter a lot? I’m afraid that my nerves will end up getting the best of me (*´-`). However, despite my worries, I will still persevere and try my best not to get moved by my anxieties!

    <p>You guys are never going to believe what just happened… So as you guys know, everyone in my class has officially turned dead on the inside. Right after I finished my presentation, (which went GREAT btw!) my teacher spilled some secrets to me. Ms. Finch said that my classmates turned into creatures called biblio-zombies, which happens to AP Research students every year. Apparently the reason why I never got infected was because I never procrastinated and fell behind, which is how the disease gets to you. At first I was mad because Ms. Finch should’ve warned us about this, but the AP College Board President has all AP teachers sworn to secrecy, where they are forced to sign some contract. <br><br><img border="10px solid #ff66cc" src="images/evil.png"> <br><br>I found out that the teachers must swear to secrecy throughout the course of the class. If they expose the secrets of the disease, there is a possibility of them getting fired or removed from the teaching college board as a whole!

    <p>OMG? It’s been so long since I logged into this. I finally remembered my password after misplacing it somewhere many years ago. The world has changed so much. People don't even BLOG anymore!! AP Research is truly a class I will never forget. It has prepared me so much for my future endeavors in college as well as in my career where my boss is always nagging me for reports bi-weekly. Despite all my worries, I got a qualifying score on my exam! My friends are also doing extremely well too! As a matter of fact, we all went on a girls trip pretty recently to Turkey. I became a journalist, like I wanted to 18 years ago. Gale became a newscaster. I see her on the news all the time whenever I turn on the TV in the mornings. Tieran recently won an award for best animated feature, and Sandra owns her own art therapy practitioner (it was featured in top 10 best up-coming businesses this year!). Tahsin became an award-winning novelist for her autobiography. Lastly, Julika became a travel influencer with a large following on social media! <br><br> - XoXo Sami

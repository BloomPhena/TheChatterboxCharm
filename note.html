  <h1>Note for AP Research Students</h1> <br> <br> 
  <a class="smallname"> <img src="images/angelheart.png" class="pfpmini"> @teamchatterboxcharm</a> <br> <br>
  <p>Use a laptop for best experience<br><br>Hello AP Researchers~! <br><br> This website has been brought to you by current seniors and AP Research students. We worked extremely hard on this website, and while it may have been difficult at times, the process was very fun! (kinda like AP Research!) This website is based on the story of the <i>"AP Research Apocalpyse,"</i> in an alternate universe, where we follow an aspiring journalist and AP Research student, <strong>Samira</strong>, on her survival journey through the perilous AP Research course. Read her blogs to receive tips on navigating this year! It's going to be hard, but you probably picked this course because you're up to the task! <br><br>Or not. XDD <br><br>Good luck!<br>xoxo <br> P.S. CLICK ON EVERYTHING YOU CAN, (hint:@Sami_Sparklez) there are some hidden functionalities (｡•̀ᴗ-)✧
